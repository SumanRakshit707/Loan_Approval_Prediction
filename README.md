Link for My App- 

**Problem Statement:**

Develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of loan approval based on applicants' information.

**Tasks:**

Task 1:

- Introduction to loan approval prediction and its significance in the banking and lending industry.
  
- Overview of classification algorithms suitable for this task.
  
Task 2:

- Data set preparation: Collect a dataset containing applicant information and loan approval labels.
  
- Perform data preprocessing, such as handling missing values, categorical features, and feature scaling.
  
Task 3:

- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and identify relevant features.
  
- Preprocess the data further, such as encoding categorical variables or handling imbalanced classes.
  
Task 4:

- Implement a baseline classification model, such as logistic regression or a decision tree classifier.
  
- Explain evaluation metrics for loan approval prediction, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
  
Task 5:

- Improve the model's performance through techniques like feature engineering or ensemble models.
  
- Discuss strategies for handling class imbalance, such as oversampling or under sampling.
- 
Task 6:

- Evaluate the model's performance on a test set and discuss the results.
  
- Identify limitations and suggest potential improvements.
  
- Prepare a presentation summarizing the findings and provide feedback.
- 
**Evaluation criteria:** Model accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and presentation quality.
  
**Dataset Format:** Gather a dataset with applicant information, including columns such as age, income, employment status, loan amount, loan purpose, and loan approval status.

**Data Types:** Numeric columns for age, income, loan amount, and categorical columns for employment status, loan purpose, and loan approval status.
